// I know visual studio, im not dumb

// Yes... im not using C# anymore... idk why, i can program in C#
// I want to make a reference of my dog here, but i dont know how to do it

	Display(2, ""); // CPP is very hard, but I think its better than C# for a kernel
	// fun fact: this module called "Display" was debugged while my dog sleeps below my bed
	// (she likes do that, i dont know why)
