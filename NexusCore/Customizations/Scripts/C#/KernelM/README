Hi there! :3 Bitos here and this is the README for the KernelMod (NexusCore) scripts.

first of all, I want to thank you for downloading this script and I hope you enjoy it! :3
secondly, I want to give you a quick overview of what this script does and how it works.

# Modules.cs

this script does some simple things with drivers (on NexusOS called Modules)
- it allows you to load and unload modules
- it allows you to list all loaded modules
- it allows you to get information about a specific module
- it allows you to get functions from a specific module, like the 'Display(2)' that prints a "> " on the screen

// How do I implement other modules?

that's a great question! :3
you need to create a void with this signature:

	public static void ModuleName(int call)
	{

		if (call == 1)
		{
	
			*run commands*

		}
		else if (call == 2)
		{
	
			*commands to load the module*

		}
		else if (call == 3)
		{
	
			*commands to stop the module*
	
		}

	}

this will allow KernelMod to call your module and execute the commands you want it to run.
I think that this will be useful just for OEMs, but its here in case you want to use it too! :3
these codes aren't just for hardware, you can use it for software commands too.
feel free to use it as you want! :3

# Program.cs

this script is a kernel, specifically KernelMod
I don't recommend you to modify this script if you don't have experience,
but if you have any experience, you can modify it as you want! :3

// How does this script work?

this script runs simple commands, and it has a simple terminal, if you want to run a command
gnome terminal still works on NexusOS, so you can use it to run commands on linux kernel

every command is separated by a public static void, so you can add your own commands
(if you want)

this code has something about 200 lines, so I will not explain every line,
and its not finished yet, so it has to be something about 1000 lines when finished

that is all for now, I hope you enjoy this script and if you have any questions,
feel free to ask me on my discord, threads or instagram! :3
I am @BitosXD on all of them!
