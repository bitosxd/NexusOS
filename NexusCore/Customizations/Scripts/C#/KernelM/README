Hi there! :3 Bitos here and this is the README for the KernelMod (NexusCore) scripts.

first of all, I want to thank you for downloading this script and I hope you enjoy it! :3
secondly, I want to give you a quick overview of what this script does and how it works.

# Modules.cs

this script does some simple things with drivers (on NexusOS called Modules)
- it allows you to load and unload modules
- it allows you to list all loaded modules
- it allows you to get information about a specific module
- it allows you to get functions from a specific module, like the 'Display(2)' that prints a "> " on the screen

// How do I implement other modules?

that's a great question! :3
you need to create a void with this signature:

	public static void ModuleName(int call)
	{

		if (call == 1)
		{
	
			*run module's commands*

		}
		else if (call == 2)
		{
	
			*commands to load the module*

		}
		else if (call == 3)
		{
	
			*commands to stop the module*
	
		}

	}

this will allow KernelMod to call your module and execute the commands you want it to run.
I think that this will be useful just for OEMs, but its here in case you want to use it too! :3
these codes aren't just for hardware, you can use it for software commands too.
feel free to use it as you want! :3

ill probably add a separate script for custom modules, that you can add many modules you want,
just using the same signature, so you can have a lot of modules in the same script

# Program.cs

this script isnt a kernel anymore, its just a simple terminal that runs commands
I don't recommend you to modify this script if you don't have experience,
but if you have any experience, you can modify it as you want! :3

// How does this script work?

this script runs simple commands, and it has a simple terminal, if you want to run a command
gnome terminal still works on NexusOS, so you can use it to run commands on linux kernel

every command is separated by a public static void, so you can add your own commands
(if you want)

this code has something about 200 lines, so I will not explain every line,
and its not finished yet, so it has to be something about 1000 lines when finished

curiosity: this script has secret commands in the terminal >:3
it don't shows when you type "help" or "?" but you can type them and they will work :3
i use these commands to test some memories addresses and some other things, so they are not documented
its just for me, the cute dev :3

one of these commands is "Console.Var.Set(cmd) --blayve" thats is a easter egg >:3

# Arch.py

this is the UNIQUE python script in the KernelM, the rest are C# scripts
this script indentifies the architecture of the device, this info is used by the kernel, futurely
for now, it just prints the architecture of the device, and saves it in the memory, futurely too

// How does this script work?

this script will use the "platform" module, to write the arch of the device in the memory
for now, it prints the arch of the device, and opens a window, that i called "AARCHmgr"
this window allows you to see the architecture of the device, and futurely, it will allow you to
view some info about your device, like the CPU, RAM, etc. like the "Win + Pause" in Windows

i know, for now this script is raw (YET) but im working on it, together with the Linux Kernel
and the KernelMod, so it will be more useful in the future :3
(i think)

# KernelM.cs

this is REALLY the kernel, and not just a terminal, like the Program.cs
this script is the main script of the KernelMod, it runs the modules, and it has some
(but Program.CS still start some render modules, like the Display module)
this script is empty for now, caus its created... now lol

// How does this script work?

it dont work yet :D
this script supposed to be the KernelM, but this think dont does anything yet, so its empty

that is all for now, I hope you enjoy this script and if you have any questions,
feel free to ask me on my discord, threads or instagram! :3
I am @BitosXD on all of them!
or you can ask on the NexusOS discord server, I will be there too! :3

Disclaimer: I did a C++ version of this kernel, but I discontinued it because I wanted to do it in C#
for me its better, cause I am more experienced in C# than in C++

phew, that was a lot of text! but i hope this was useful for you
Bye! :3
