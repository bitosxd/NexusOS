Hi! :3 Byt3z here, and this is the README for the KernelMod folder
first, this part of the system is separated by 2 folders, the C# KernelMod, and the C++ KernelMod. The most current version of KernelMod is in C++, because Im migrating the code in C# to C++, and the next updates will be entirely focused on KernelMod in C++. And then, once i migrate all the code from C# to C++, the C# version will be completely removed from the system.

# CPP :
this is the main part, and is the KernelMod, i dont really know how this code works, im learning C++ now, but i know sometings.

KernelMod.cpp:

void start()
{

    // the start code, that runs just one time on KernelMod finishes boot

}

void update()
{

    // repeats the code 1 time per frame
    // in that code i use this to repeat the command input

}

void boot()
{

    // DO NOT do anything here, this void starts all the modules and the KernelMod

}
